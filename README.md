This is a simple note-taking app with authentication developed on MERN stack

For my system, the MongoDB server is running on localhost port: 27017, change the port number of the mongodb server in backend/db.js 

In the backend folder and the main project folder:
```
npm i
```

In the main project folder:
```
npm run both
```
